# Purpose:
# In a file called lines.py, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument,
# ...the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of code in that file,
# ...excluding comments and blank lines.

# Condition:
# If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument,
# ...or if the specified fileâ€™s name does not end in .py,
# ...or if the specified file does not exist,
# ...the program should instead exit via sys.exit.


#Too few command-line arguments
#Too many command-line arguments
#Not a Python file
#File does not exist
